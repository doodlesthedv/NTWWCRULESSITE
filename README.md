NTWWC Rules & Guidelines

Rules
Moderation Guidelines

Basic Rules
1. No E-Dating/Online Romance
This is a chatroom to discuss Nitro Type, not for online dating.

2. No Swearing / Using Slurs
Swears & slurs are unnecessary, they just lead to toxicity.
“Censoring” swears/slurs are not allowed either. (e.g, f**k, s**t)

3. Keep Content SFW (Safe for Work)
The chatroom caters to people under 18, please keep things clean. (Search the definition of NSFW for a list of things not allowed in the chat.)

4. Respect Others Privacy, And Your Own
Please do not post things that may disrupt people’s privacy.
This includes, but is not limited to, locations, names, passwords, etc.
Be safe on the internet, do not post photos or videos of yourself, or your locations, names, passwords, etc.

5. No Spamming / Flooding The Chat
Please try your best to keep the chat on topic. This doesn’t mean not to have fun chatting, please just try and not flood the chat with nonsense.


what you do in one chat doesn’t affect other chats, unless it’s something illegal. So, if you break a rule like swearing, you’ll only be banned from that specific chat. This way, each chat handles its own rules, and you aren’t punished everywhere for one mistake.

The top statement is null and void if you do illegal activities.
